## CSECWA Week 9 Mongoose Example

#### Problem Statement

TV shows are scattered across several streaming platforms. There is no single repository that allows users to
see which shows are available on which platforms using the API.

Shows can be queried against one or more params - name - genre - imdb_rating - platform

#### Getting started

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. Folder structure

nem_example
|\_db
|\_helpers
|\_middleware
|\_routes
|\_server.js

- db contains mongodb schema
- helpers contains mongoose and express helper functions
- middleware contains express-middleware
- routes contains express routes
- `server.js` is entry point for the app

#### Issues

For issues, please create issue on the repo.
